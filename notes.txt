open( ‘GET’, ‘comicselect.CGI?parameters’,1)
comicselect.CGI clips an image, places it in a directory with a randomly generated name, returns the path to it
displayComic() to create an element with the path returned by comicselect.CGI
comicselect.txt, contains the path to a fixed image


Get a server running on windows!!
1.  AJAX request for a file whose content (response text) is a link to an image
Javascript opens reader.html to display that image
2.  AJAX request now goes to a CGI script (php) on the server side that (a) copies an image with a new name, and (b) prints out (responseText) the path to the new image
3.  CGI script clips an image based on user input

Next:
JS how to select actual region.
give user ability to select region
button to enable selection
retrieve coordinates. 
click button -> move mouse to certain region (upper left to bottom right)
modify display: instead of display image create canvas with url of pic
Might need 3rd party tools in the end

Due:
1) Just display two coordinates with file name
2) backend php that will perform cropping with watermarking
3) Maybe another window pops up with url link and cropping (allow people with permission to use url)
